# Kale Analytics Dashboard

A comprehensive analytics dashboard that unifies data from **Instantly** and **Email Bison** into a single source-of-truth in Supabase, providing actionable insights for decision-making.

## üéØ **Core Mission**

Unify data from (Instantly + Email Bison) into a single source of truth in Supabase, then visualize it to enable the team for decision-making, without being limited by the native dashboards of those tools, with accurate syncing, historical data, and actionable insights.

**Key Business Context:**
- **Two Main Platforms**: Instantly and Email Bison (same purpose, different UIs)
- **Lead Management**: Lists built outside sequencers, manually mapped into campaigns
- **Campaign Structure**: Multiple steps with A/B testing (e.g., 5 variations in step 2)
- **Reply Processing**: Missive consolidates all replies with GPT sentiment analysis
- **Unique Email Identifier**: "True email address" system for cross-platform deduplication
- **Weekly Monitoring**: Track performance changes and detect deliverability issues
- **Automated Actions**: System recognizes issues and creates tasks automatically

## üìä **Core Five Metrics Tracked**

1. **Reply Rate (%)** and raw reply count
2. **Positive Reply Rate (%)** and positive reply count  
3. **Bounce/Balance Rate (%)** and raw count
4. **Emails Sent (total)** and unique leads contacted
5. **Send ‚Üí Positive Reply Ratio** (number of sends per positive reply)
6. **Operational: Inbox Sending Capacity Usage** ‚Äî e.g., did a mailbox hit its daily send allowance?
